summary: The most extensive terrestrial biome, drylands cover more than one-third of Earth’s continental surface. The moss genus *Syntrichia* occurs worldwide in a variety of habitats and is comprised of about 90 species, many of which are dryland specialists.
abstract: The most extensive terrestrial biome, drylands cover more than one-third of Earth’s continental surface. The moss genus *Syntrichia* occurs worldwide in a variety of habitats and is comprised of about 90 species, many of which are dryland specialists. Previous research indicates the presence of a single clade, recently named Borealsyntrichia, containing both the diverse *S. ruralis* and *S. caninervis* species complexes and that may represent a rapid radiation. We aim to understand whether the genus *Syntrichia* contains diversification rate shifts and whether timing of the divergence of Borealsyntrichia coincides with the evolution of Northern Hemisphere deserts. Using a genome skimming approach, we assembled plastomes de novo for 144 samples of *Syntrichia* and close relatives from around the world. From these assemblies we selected 86 plastid genes to build a phylogeny, estimate divergence times, and test for temporal diversification heterogeneity in a Bayesian framework. We report when *Syntrichia* diverged from the rest of Pottiaceae as well as an estimated divergence time of Borealsyntrichia from the rest of *Syntrichia* and whether we find support for association of this divergence with development of Northern Hemisphere deserts. Tests for temporal shifts diversification rate will indicate if, during its evolutionary history, *Syntrichia* had any drastic diversification rate shifts. Our results will provide context on the dominance of Borealsyntrichia in Northern Hemisphere drylands.
