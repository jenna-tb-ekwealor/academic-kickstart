summary: A global phylogeny of the dryland moss genus *Syntrichia*.
abstract: "Though its approximately 90 named species occur in varied habitats worldwide, the moss genus *Syntrichia* is known for its dryland specialists, demonstrating a remarkable amount of variation in life history and ecology. The goal of this study was to understand the higher-level relationships of the genus. We addressed the following questions (1) Is *Syntrichia*, as currently defined, a monophyletic group? (2) What are the closest relatives of *Syntrichia*? (3) What are the major clades within this group? and (4) What can we tell aout its biogeographic history? Our research group is undertaking phylogenetic analyses of *Syntrichia* at several scales; here we report results based on data from a genome skimming approach. We sequenced 608 samples chosen to represent the full biogeographic, morphological, and taxonomic variation in the group. From *de novo* genome assemblies for each sample and from mining NCBI Genbank, we selected a small set of loci: chloroplast *rbc*l, *rps*4, and *trn*L-*trn*F; mitochondrial *nad*5; nuclear rDNA (including ITS regions), and 9 single-copy nuclear loci. Phylogenetic analysis proceeded in two steps using an ML approach (1) analyzing each locus separately to compare gene tree topologies; (2) concatenating all loci into a single matrix to infer the backbone phylogeny. Results include a well-supported *Syntrichia* clade and the discovery of a diverse, primarily Northern Hemisphere clade that includes the *S. ruralis* complex and *S. caninervis* complex and may represent a recent and extensie radiation in ecology and morphology. We also find evidence of a Southern Hemisphere origin with  multiple northward transitions."
