title: How mosses thrive in the desert: Adaptation, acclimation, and refugia
event: Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Colloquium
event_url: []
location: University of Colorado, Boulder
summary: A summary of some key adaptations in and my latest eco-physiology research on the Mojave Desert moss *Syntrichia caninervis*.
abstract: While the thought of mosses may conjure up a scene of a damp, dark forest, mosses are actually common in deserts. We'll explore some of the genetic, physiological, and ecological adaptations that mosses in the family Pottiaceae have developed to survive the challenges of high light and low water habitats.
