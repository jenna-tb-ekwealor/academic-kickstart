title: "Adaptation, acclimation, and refugia: How mosses survive and thrive in the desert"
event: California Botanical Society Seminar Series
event_url: https://mailchi.mp/3079c8fd6fee/botanyspeakerseries-5210903
location: California Botanical Society Seminar Series Virtual
summary: While the thought of mosses may conjure up a scene of a damp, dark forest, mosses are actually common in deserts. This talk will cover some of my recent research on the genetic, physiological, and ecological adaptations that mosses in the genus Syntrichia (Pottiaceae) have to survive in the high light and low water habitat of California's Mojave Desert.
