Recently I completed my last fieldwork trip for my dissertation! Let's take a moment to celebrate that fact before moving on to the topic of this post. 

...

Great. So, this last field trip was actually pretty low-key. I was just going to collect some environmental sensors/data loggers from the sites where I had my UV-reducing windows. I had 6 sensors out there in two sets of 3. The first three were in place and all went well with them. The second set, however, had only 2 sensors in place and the third one had disappeared.
