Desert and dryland mosses spend much of their time in a desiccated and quiescent state—a strategy that allows them to avoid some physiological stress when water is limited or absent. However, these plants must still deal with consequences of their harsh environment upon rehydration and ‘waking up.’ To understand more about how dryland mosses cope with or limit damage from the environment while desiccated, I am investigating the mechanisms of UV radiation protection in *Syntrichia caninervis* using a year-long UV reduction experiment in the Mojave Desert.
