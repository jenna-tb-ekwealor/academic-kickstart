Desert and dryland mosses spend much of their time in a desiccated and quiescent state; a "strategy" that allows them to avoid some physiological stress when water is limited or absent. However, these plants must still deal with consequences of their harsh environment upon rehydration and ‘waking up.’ To understand more about how dryland mosses cope with or limit damage from the environment while desiccated, I am investigating the role of UV radiation in stress (including desiccation) tolerance and photosynthesis in *Syntrichia caninervis* using a variety of field and laboratory experiments.
